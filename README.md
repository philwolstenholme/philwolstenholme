## About me

Hi :wave:!

I'm a lead frontend engineer at the [Co-op](https://github.com/coopdigital).

I have a wide range of skills, knowledge, and experience, particularly focussed on accessibility and frontend web performance. 

Outside of work I'm interested in science, the environment, bouldering, bikes (everyday/utility), and open source software.

## :toolbox: Tools I like

Currently I'm working on a React e-commerce SPA, but previously I did a lot of work with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/u/phil-wolstenholme).

I'm a big fan of things like 11ty, Vue, Alpine and utility-first CSS. 

I like tools that allow server rendered HTML and my work focuses as much as I can on performance and accessibility.

## :speaking_head: Public speaking

I like public speaking and am always looking for chances to do more. Here are a few recorded talks:

* [Progressive decoupling with Drupal and Vue, DrupalCon Europe, Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBLlwvM_uPc)
* [Using a utility-first CSS (with Tailwind CSS) and a component-first approach in Drupal, DrupalCon Europe, Remote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYY1teFZ_Fk)
